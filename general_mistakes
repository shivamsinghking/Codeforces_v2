1. Check long for over flow can and MODULO

MATRIX | ARRAYS adjancet elements
2. When there is matching or difference type question, once see consider parity of questions as well.

NUMBER THEORY
1. for (0, n, x) is taking longer time that ( for 0, n/x, 1) [ Colin galen numer thoery sheet - Problem M]
2. Remember 10^9 get Prime factors -> you need only 31268 values, seive(31268) and generate all primes in range [0, 31268]
   


GRAPH THEORY
1. When doing bfs are any thing where O(N) is close to 10^7 -> try to only make use of array
   instead of Deque OR Queue to avoid TLE.
2. 


CONSTRUCTIVE ALGO
1. If you find, that sequence of number, or steps doesn't matter then try to calculate the contribution on each element in the answer
